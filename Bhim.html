                  The National Payments Corporation of India created the Unified Payments Interface-based mobile payment app called BHIM. 
                  It was introduced on December 30th, 2016 with the goal of facilitating bank-to-bank electronic payments and promoting cashless transactions. 
                  Bharat Interface for Money is the official name of BHIM. 
                  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) created the app specifically for mobile payments.

               <p class="col-md-10">
                
UPI based payments have literally exploded over the past couple of years. 

3rd Party apps like PhonePe, GPay have pretty much captured the market for UPI based payments, with significant gains in volumes and transactions. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  However, one player that has seen a decrease in market share is BHIM. While some of this is attributable to lack of discounts and 
                  merchant push, visually and UX wise, BHIM does feel like a step back when compared to the likes of PhonePe, GPay, Paytm and several 
                  other neobank apps. This is despite the app having no "functional issues" and being rather easy to use.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p class="mb-0">So, in this challenge, you need to enhance the overall look and feel of the BHIM app: the focus
                     should be on the screens that form the payment flows, as this is the use case that matters the most to users.  </p>

                  Personas are made-up users whose objectives and traits stand in for the requirements of a wider user base.
To reflect the main user groups, personas must be created by UX designers through evaluation, research, and creation.
These user groups are developed using responses, routines, or characteristics that numerous interviewees have in common.

                  The user always comes first in the field of UX design. 
                  But, in order to prioritise user demands, we must first understand who we're talking about. 
                  So, let's have a look at personalities.

                  Therefore, let's examine personalities.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  The simplest kind of trip mapping starts by constructing a timeline from a list of user actions. 
                  Then, in order to create a tale, user emotions and feelings are added to the timeline. This narrative has been condensed and streamlined, 
                  and it concludes with a visualisation.
                  
                </p>
                
                Therefore, you might be unsure of how to use a customer journey map once you've built one. A customer journey map's primary goal is to keep 
                the customer and their experience at the forefront of everyone's thoughts. Customers trip maps are frequently displayed in the workplace or 
                made readily available to all workers. This manner, the demands of the user may be consistently taken into account throughout the design 
                process by all staff members.
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  Here are two user journey maps that demonstrate how different individuals approach processes and feel about them.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  A user flow is a visual representation of the various paths that can be taken when using an app or website, which can be written out or 
                  created digitally. The flowchart starts with the consumer's first interaction with the product, and finishes with the final action or result. 
                  
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  User flows also make it simple to describe the product's flow to your stakeholders and provide them a 
                  basic idea of how the interface you've designed is supposed to behave in its most efficient form. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  By assisting your design team in visualizing how users will interact with the product, 
                  you can ensure that everyone is on the same page, resulting in a more productive and enjoyable work environment.
                  User flows depict these potential patterns in a way that allows designers to evaluate the efficiency of the interface they're working on.

                  One of India's leading e-commerce payment platforms is PhonePe Private Limited. The firm that makes digital 
                  wallets was established in December 2015. This website provides services in more than 11 regional Indian languages. 
                  As a user, you may use the app to book taxis, reserve hotel rooms, place online food orders, pay for Redbus tickets,
                   and purchase aeroplane tickets.
                </p>
              </div>
                
                <p >
  
                  Currently, Yes Bank is working with the service to power it. A user must provide their registered mobile number 
                  to register when downloading PhonePe. A user will then have a UPI ID, which they may use to conduct any transactions,
                  and all the information required for a transaction will be live at that point. 
  
                </p>
  
                <p >
                  All we have to do is download the PhonePe software to our smartphones, link our bank accounts and phone numbers, 
                  and after these have been validated, we can begin using the app to conduct transactions. The associated bank accounts 
                  are directly connected to the PhonePe transactions. 
                  Additionally, since the PhonePe wallet is connected to a bank account, it does not need to be refilled once again.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  A wireframe is a low-fidelity outline of a digital experience, like an app or website.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10">
                     Purposes of wireframes:</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Establish the basic structure of a page</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Highlight the intended function of the product</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Save time and resources</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10">The wireframes will be made up of elements. Elements are building blocks used for creating a design. 
                      Most of the time, you'll use lines, shapes, and text to draw wireframes.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"> •	Text is represented by horizontal lines.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Images, photos, illustrations, and icons are represented by a square or rectangle and an X overlapping the square or rectangle.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Calls-to-action are often represented by rectangles or circles. A common example of a call-to-action is a “submit” button on a web form.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"> Wireframes benefit you as the designer; they enable you to:</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Identify the content to include in your product</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Catch problems early</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Get stakeholders to focus on structure</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Save time and effort</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Iterate quickly</p>

                <p class="col-md-10">A quick and simple method for turning high-level design concepts into observable and testable 
                  prototypes is low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping. 
                  Lo-fi prototypes' primary and most crucial job is to test and verify functioning, not the product's aesthetic appeal.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10">Here are the basic characteristics of low-fidelity prototyping:</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>	Visual design:</b> Only a few of the final product's visual characteristics are displayed (such as shapes of elements, basic visual hierarchy, etc.).</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>Content:</b> Only the most important parts of the content are presented.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>Interactivity:</b> A real person can imitate the prototype. During a testing session, a specific person who is knowledgeable about design assumes the 
                    role of a computer and manually modifies the design's state in real-time. Wireframes, commonly referred to as <b>"connected wireframes" </b>
                    can be used to generate interactivity.</p>

                  fidelity of the prototype. In this sense, a high-fidelity prototype is an interactive computer-based depiction of the product that comes 
                  the closest to the final design in terms of features and functionality. It is sometimes referred to as high-fidelity or hi-fidelity. 
                  High-fidelity refers to a level of comprehensiveness that enables in-depth analysis of usability issues and the drawing of inferences on user behaviour. </p>
                  <p class="col-md-10">
                    The high-fidelity prototypes encompass both the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)

            <p >
              The BHIM wallet also includes a passbook where users may track their spending and, like with transactions, establish spending limits. This passbook is shown in a bar chart style so users can have a more detailed view of their daily transactions.
