                  To further their education or find employment, many students and employees travel to various cities.
                  Such a group of individuals will completely alter their way of life, including their accommodations,
                  diets, and modes of transportation. Many of my classmates who moved to my institution from Andhra Pradesh
                  are residing in PGs and can afford to eat out every day. We may thus regularly send meals as a remedy for this.

                   to start a business in order to support their families are unable to do so. Many mothers, housewives, cooks, 
                   and others who don't work may generate money from home while providing food for other people.

                  The user always comes first in the field of UX design. 
                  But, in order to prioritise user demands, we must first understand who we're talking about. 
                  So, let's have a look at personalities.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  Personas are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. 
                  As a UX Designer You'll need to assess, investigate, and construct personas to represent major user groups as a UX designer.
                  Similar replies, habits, or traits shared by several interview participants are used to create these user groups. 
                  
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  This implies that they reflect a wider group of users that share similar viewpoints, attitudes, 
                  and personality characteristics. Understanding that several consumers fall into the same broad group 
                  aids in defining the sorts of individuals for whom you're developing. That's where personas come in.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  In its most basic version, journey mapping begins by creating a timeline from a sequence of user actions. After then,
                  user emotions and feelings are added to the timeline in order to build a story. This story has been streamlined and compressed, 
                  and it ends with a visualisation.

                  A visual representation of a customer using your product or service is referred to as a user journey map. 
                  Although there is a case to be made that the term "customer" does the method a disservice , 
                  alignment on the term "map" is far less significant than alignment on the content contained within the map.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  A user flow is a visual representation of the various paths that can be taken when using an app or website, which can be written out or 
                  created digitally. The flowchart starts with the consumer's first interaction with the product, and finishes with the final action or result. 
                  
                </p>
                
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  User flows also make it simple to describe the product's flow to your stakeholders and provide them a 
                  basic idea of how the interface you've designed is supposed to behave in its most efficient form. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-10">
                  By assisting your design team in visualizing how users will interact with the product, 
                  you can ensure that everyone is on the same page, resulting in a more productive and enjoyable work environment.
                  User flows depict these potential patterns in a way that allows designers to evaluate the efficiency of the interface they're working on.

                <p class="col-md-10">
                  A wireframe is a low-fidelity outline of a digital experience, like an app or website.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10">
                     Purposes of wireframes:</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Establish the basic structure of a page</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Highlight the intended function of the product</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10" style="padding-left:20px">•	Save time and resources</p>
                     <p class="col-md-10">The wireframes will be made up of elements. Elements are building blocks used for creating a design. 
                      Most of the time, you'll use lines, shapes, and text to draw wireframes.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"> •	Text is represented by horizontal lines.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Images, photos, illustrations, and icons are represented by a square or rectangle and an X overlapping the square or rectangle.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Calls-to-action are often represented by rectangles or circles. A common example of a call-to-action is a “submit” button on a web form.</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"> Wireframes benefit you as the designer; they enable you to:</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Identify the content to include in your product</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Catch problems early</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Get stakeholders to focus on structure</p>
                      <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px">•	Save time and effort</p>

                <p class="col-md-10">A quick and simple method for turning high-level design concepts into observable and testable 
                  prototypes is low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping. 
                  Lo-fi prototypes' primary and most crucial job is to test and verify functioning, not the product's aesthetic appeal.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10">Here are the basic characteristics of low-fidelity prototyping:</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>	Visual design:</b> Only a few of the final product's visual characteristics are displayed (such as shapes of elements, basic visual hierarchy, etc.).</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>Content:</b> Only the most important parts of the content are presented.</p>
                  <p class="col-md-10"style="padding-left:20px"><b>Interactivity:</b> A real person can imitate the prototype. During a testing session, a specific person who is knowledgeable about design assumes the 
                    role of a computer and manually modifies the design's state in real-time. Wireframes, commonly referred to as <b>"connected wireframes" </b>
                    can be used to generate interactivity.</p>

                  fidelity of the prototype. In this sense, a high-fidelity prototype is an interactive computer-based depiction of the product that comes 
                  the closest to the final design in terms of features and functionality. It is sometimes referred to as high-fidelity or hi-fidelity. 
                  High-fidelity refers to a level of comprehensiveness that enables in-depth analysis of usability issues and the drawing of inferences on user behaviour. </p>
